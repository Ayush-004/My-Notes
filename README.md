App Description:

Flutter source code for a note-taking app can be in this repository. It requires the user to give an email address and a password to register successfully. The user must also verify their email to proceed with the application. The app then leads to the app's main UI, the notes view, where we can do the following operations.

* New notes can be added using the plus icon on the app bar. The application leads the user to a blank page where they can add notes when clicking the plus icon. 

* The user can exit and resume from the same point at any time, as the notes are automatically saved when the back button is pressed to leave the writing page. 

* Existing notes are listed on the landing page, and clicking on any note displays its contents.

* A delete confirmation dialogue is displayed when the user deletes a note from the notes view.

* The user can log out of the application, and a confirmation popup is shown to confirm this action.
