App Description:

Flutter source code for a note-taking app can be in this repository. It requires the user to give an email address and a password to register successfully. The user must also verify their email to proceed with the application. The app then leads to the app's main UI, the notes view, where we can do the following operations.

* New notes can be added using the plus icon on the app bar. The application leads the user to a blank page where they can add notes when clicking the plus icon. 

* The user can exit and resume from the same point at any time, as the notes are automatically saved when the back button is pressed to leave the writing page. 

* Existing notes are listed on the landing page, and clicking on any note displays its contents.

* A delete confirmation dialogue is displayed when the user deletes a note from the notes view.

* The user can log out of the application, and a confirmation popup is shown to confirm this action.

The course I followed taught me a lot of things. From creating and developing my first app to being able to complete a course, I took it dedicatedly and consistently every day. Flutter was the first thing I genuinely enjoyed doing in development and not doing for its sake.
I started to follow this course a little more than three weeks ago. One of the first challenges I faced was some concepts of Object Oriented Programming, like constructors, custom operators, overriding methods, @immutable, extensions, etc.
AuthService:
I faced significant challenges when I started to code the backend for the authentication and notes to work and connect. Initially, everything felt very abstract when things started, and I had a hard time understanding why we were doing certain things and how they were implemented. 
After getting the hang of things, I tried to implement Google Sign In, and I could sign in using google. Still, I couldn't make it mesh with the other parts of my application, which resulted in my app crashing whenever I signed in with google.


CRUD local storage:
 This was something entirely new for me, and again at the beginning, I couldn't understand why we were doing things the way they were. Sometimes I couldn't understand a particular concept's true meaning, but I assumed it to be something and moved on. And then, later on, in the course, I realised what that meant. This course taught me patience and googling stuff. I learned a lot of things on the go. The most challenging portion of the course for me was the backend development part, where I couldn't significantly see the advancements in my application as it just layed the groundwork for everything to work, and it seemed challenging to me at the same time.
I still have some gaps in my knowledge, which I will be able to fill properly once I rewatch the course, as I will be able to understand each thing better and its intent. 

I enjoyed the journey, it felt really good to have a goal for which you did something every day, and you could track how many hours you did each day. And I had started to respect the many things that the software I use daily was able to do.
The course not only taught me how to learn Flutter, it also tried to teach me how to be a good Software Developer, and I will continue this journey to where it leads.
